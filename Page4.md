		     I attended St.Charles CC before coming to UM. Originally I went there to play baseball but after a couple of months I realized I didn't enjoy the process after everything that happened with COVID. The sport now became a chore instead of something that I poured my entire time into and decided to quit. After this time, I decided to finish out the Fall and Spring semesters to save money, as I wasn't missing anything at a big university.</p>
